# Notes Site

I am a graduate student in biophysics in ZJU. This site shows some of my notes on Linux \& softwares, molecular dynamics simulation tutorials \& experiences, and notes on core courses. I'm a huge fan of science, interested in all kinds of problems in math, physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy, and so on. I watch videos on fun science/stories/philosophy during the spare time. The more we know, the clearer we can see the universe and ourselves. 

IT techniques like python coding, LaTeX, setup a blog, processing videos, etc are a good way to relax. These are cool things aside from our research, right? I want to share everything in this site to save our time googling all day long for solution. 

My hobbies are traveling (also riding, climbing), ball sports, watching movies or shows, listening to books. Some TODOs: take a picture of the milky way, visit all six continents (2 already), 100k followers at bilibili, .....and most importantly, no one can impose meaning on life, so **Always Do What Brings Me Happiness**.

**My Bilibili channel**: [东山月光下](https://space.bilibili.com/441196634). From time to time, I will share full courses, specialized mini-lecture, animated demonstrations and cutting-edge lectures in macromolecular structure study, molecular dynamics simulation/statistical thermodynamics, oncology and immunology. English-Chinese dual subtitles are added for videos from YouTube. Please subscribe and triple click (一键三连)!

I created a **VScode syntax highlighting extension** [md-highlighter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gxf1212.md-highlighter) that highlight files about molecular modeling and molecular dynamics simulation. This extension provides comprehensive coverage of commonly used file formats under various popular tools, including Gromacs, Amber, AmberTools, NAMD, VMD, and more. It also performs detailed keyword parsing, helping users to locate and edit information within files more quickly. Users can even identify syntax errors quickly based on different colors. Feel free to download and try it out, and don't hesitate to recommend it to your colleagues!

The site's bottom left corner (after hiding the outline) features **a Live2D hostess** [三体风Live2D看板娘](https://github.com/gxf1212/live2d-widget) that I've carefully curated with many favorite quotes from the famous science fiction "The Three-Body Problem". If you're interested, you can fork the project or contribute some sentences of your own.

But most small tricks and pieces of code are here. I don't like one blog and another since they are hard to organize and update. Once I wished this site could serve as an encyclopedia, but the content ends up too messy and diverse. And sadly docsify blogs cannot be reached by search engines. And it's not beautiful though I add a lot of features. So I do this for myself. But finally what matters is what I remember. I think everyone should have his/her own encyclopedia, as a technique of learning.

Anyway, welcome to this site!
