# Research hub

This is research hub page. Click on the sidebar to select a chapter and start reading!

- [Programming for MD](/research/Programming-for-MD.md): Python, tcl, bash, specific Python packages, etc.
- [Common tools for MD](/research/Common-tools.md): visualization programs, molecular dynamics basics, Gromacs/NAMD/Amber basics, etc.
- [Preparation and modeling](/research/Preparation-and-modeling.md): general modeling: protein (AF2, Swiss-Model, etc.), protonation state, Leap/VMD, packmol, docking and VS (distribute to other pages later?)
- [Protein-ligand simulation](/research/Protein-ligand-simulation.md): MD/FEP with all MD engines
- [Protein/Amino Acid FEP](/research/AA-MD-FEP.md): MD/FEP with all MD engines
- [Systems with metal ions](/research/Metal-ion.md)
- [Fragments of science](/research/academic-notes.md)
- [MD official tutorials](/research/Previous-projects/MD-tutorials-all.md)

In the future, I will try not to write pages by project, but will still focus on specific themes in each page.
- [NUS project: virtual screening and MD simulation with Gromacs](/research/Previous-projects/UROPS-run-and-result.md)
- [FYP project: FEP on small molecules with NAMD](/research/Previous-projects/FYP-notes.md)
