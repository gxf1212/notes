  The thermodynamical preference of the harder N and O--containing side chains for the “soft” Hg rather than the “borderline” Zn is probably due to relativistic effects resulting in a strong stabilization of mercury's vacant 6s orbitals, which in turn enhances its electron-accepting ability.

  charge transfer from the ligands to Hg<sup>2+</sup> (0.49−0.62 e) is greater than that to Zn<sup>2+</sup> (0.32−0.41 e), indicating that Hg<sup>2+</sup> can accept more negative charge from the ligands than Zn<sup>2+</sup>.

### Metal and Metalloproteins

#### Basics

- one-third of all proteins are estimated to be metalloprotein

- For example, the average concentrations of free Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the blood plasma are ∼145, ∼4, ∼1.5, and ∼1.8 mM, respectively, while those in the cytosol are ∼12, ∼139, ∼0.8, and <0.2 × 10<sup>–3</sup> mM, respectively. (6) At the same time, the intracellular concentration of the free transition metals such as Zn<sup>2+</sup> (10<sup>–10</sup>–10<sup>–15</sup> M) (7-9) and Cu<sup>+</sup> (∼10<sup>–18</sup> M) (10) is kept very low, yet the cellular/extracellular proteins in a healthy organism select with high fidelity the “right” metal ion against a background of, sometimes, higher concentrations of competing cations.

- “Alien metal cations” refers to metal cations that are not native to a particular biological system or molecule. For example, in the context of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which exists in solution mostly as ATP-Mg, Mg<sup>2+<sup/> would be considered the native metal cation while other metal cations such as Li+ would be considered alien

- [Irving–Williams series - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving–Williams_series): stability of complexes, Mn(II) < Fe(II) < Co(II) < Ni(II) < Cu(II) > Zn(II)

  Natural [proteins'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein) affinities for metal binding also follow the Irving–Williams series? Of course there are selective proteins...

#### Metal-protein interactions

- Mammalian metallothioneins (MTs) are a group of cysteine-rich proteins that bind metal ions in two α- and β-domains and represent a major cellular Zn(II)/Cu(I) buffering system in the cell.
- Heavy metal ions can precipitate proteins by bonding with negatively charged parts of the protein molecule, reducing the tendency of the protein to attract a layer of water molecules around it, allowing the protein molecules to interact with one another and precipitate out of solution.
  - Cadmium can replace zinc, but is toxic because it does not have the same catalytic ability.
  - Mercury can bind to thiol groups, which are found in the amino acid cysteine in proteins. This can disrupt the function of proteins and enzymes that contain cysteine residues. Mercury can also replace zinc ions in certain proteins (SH)
- Cys-rich proteins have been used by living organisms to fight heavy metal intoxication. Cys-rich proteins such as metallothionein are used as traps to sequester nonbiogenic metal ions from the body fluids

## Organic Chemistry

- 芳香甲酸酯，相比于脂肪族羧酸酯，更不易水解。

  Generally speaking, aromatic esters are more stable than aliphatic esters towards hydrolysis under both acidic and basic conditions.
  The rate-limiting step of hydrolysis of carboxylic esters under basic condition is the nucleophilic attack of hydroxide ion on the carbonyl carbon of the ester.

  - the aromatic ring stabilizes the carbonyl group of the ester by resonance, making it less reactive towards nucleophilic attack by water or hydroxide ions. (electronic)
  - Aromatic carboxylic esters are also more difficult to hydrolyze than aliphatic carboxylic esters because they form less stable tetrahedral intermediates during the reaction. (size)

  However, aromatic esters may have electron-withdrawing groups that increase their reactivity towards hydrolysis. Some aliphatic esters may have bulky groups that hinder their hydrolysis.

### Lipids

The most abundant membrane lipids are the phospholipids. These have a polar head group and two hydrophobic hydrocarbon tails.
[Phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) are the most abundant phospholipids in all mammalian cell membranes](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28411170/).
**[Phosphatidylcholine](https://www.bing.com/ck/a?!&&p=d0affee344b2ba32JmltdHM9MTY3OTA5NzYwMCZpZ3VpZD0yYmEyOWMwMi1lZDI3LTZlNTQtMDBmNC04ZWJlZWM2ZDZmODgmaW5zaWQ9NTQyNw&ptn=3&hsh=3&fclid=2ba29c02-ed27-6e54-00f4-8ebeec6d6f88&u=a1L3NlYXJjaD9xPVBob3NwaGF0aWR5bGNob2xpbmUmZmlsdGVycz1zaWQlM2E3N2E0ZWJjNy0zM2UyLTk1ZWItNjM3Ni1iZGFiNjA0YjIwYzAmZm9ybT1FTlRMTks&ntb=1)** and **phosphatidylethanolamine** are the two main **phospholipids** in eukaryotic cells comprising ~50 and 25% of phospholipid mass, respectively.



[Phospholipids are a class of lipids that consist of two fatty acyl molecules esterified at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of glycerol, and contain a head group linked by a phosphate residue at the sn-3 position](https://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/chemistry/physics/animal-lipids/phospholipid-biosynthesis)[2](https://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/chemistry/physics/animal-lipids/phospholipid-biosynthesis). [The hydrocarbon in the “sn-2” position refers to the second fatty acid chain attached to the glycerol backbone](https://lipidlibrary.aocs.org/chemistry/physics/animal-lipids/phospholipid-biosynthesis).

The carbon atom that appears on top in the Fischer projection that shows a vertical carbon chain with the hydroxyl group at carbon-2 to the left is designated as C-1. [To differentiate such numbering from conventional numbering conveying no steric information, the prefix ‘sn’ (for stereospecifically numbered) is used](https://avantilipids.com/tech-support/faqs/meaning-of-sn)[1](https://avantilipids.com/tech-support/faqs/meaning-of-sn).

## Thermodynamics & kinetics

The inhibitory constant (Ki) is a type of equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) that represents the equilibrium binding affinity for a ligand that reduces the activity of its binding partner.

Ki is associated with thermodynamic parameters in that ΔG = RTln(Ki), where ΔG, R, and T are the absolute binding free energy, the gas constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively



The turnover number of an enzyme (kcat or catalytic rate constant) is <u>the maximal number of molecules of substrate converted to product per active site per unit time of several different substrates to different products</u>.



How to estimate how long a substrate stays at the active site? Given the M-M equation:
$$
v=k_{cat}\dfrac{[E][S]}{K_m+[S]}
$$
meaning how many substrates are converted per unit time. So $\dfrac{v}{[E]}$ means how many substrates are converted per unit time per unit enzyme, or $\dfrac{[E]}{v}$ means how long it takes for **one enzyme molecule** to convert one substrate molecule to the product.
$$
t=\dfrac{1+K_m/[S]}{k_{cat}}
$$

- reversibly proportional to $k_{cat}$. For protein kinases with $k_{cat}$ of several seconds<sup>-1</sup>, it should require seconds to simulate the whole process.
- $t$ increases dramatically if $[S]$ is much lower than $K_m$, usually in 0.x µM

## Quantum chemistry

- In quantum chemistry, the Hessian matrix is a matrix of second derivatives of a molecule’s energy with respect to its atomic coordinates. It is used to describe the curvature of the potential energy surface near a stationary point, such as a minimum or transition state. The Hessian matrix can be used to determine the vibrational frequencies of a molecule and its normal modes of vibration

# Pharmacology

## Concepts

- The inhibitory constant ($K_i$) is a type of [equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd)](https://pharmacologycanada.org/equilibrium-dissociation-constant-Kd) that represents the equilibrium binding [affinity](https://pharmacologycanada.org/Affinity) for a ligand that reduces the activity of its binding partner.

  $K_i$ is associated with thermodynamic parameters in that $\Delta G = RT\ln(K_i)$, where $\Delta G$, $R$ , and $T$ are the absolute binding free energy, the gas constant, and the absolute temperature, respectively

- In-house drug discovery refers to the process of discovering new drugs within a company or organization, rather than outsourcing the process to another company.

### Macrolide

大环内酯（Macrolide）是一类广谱抗生素，能够有效抑制细菌的生长和繁殖。大环内酯分子结构由16-环的大环和一定的糖基组成，作用于细菌的机理主要是通过抑制细菌蛋白质的合成。

具体来说，大环内酯可与细菌的50S亚基上的23S rRNA结合，阻止细菌RNA依赖性蛋白合成。此外，大环内酯还可以诱导靶菌的形态学变化，使其形态异常，从而使其生长和繁殖受到抑制。

值得注意的是，由于细菌和人类细胞的核糖体结构存在差异，大环内酯对于人类细胞的影响比较小，因此在治疗感染时，大环内酯具有较低的毒副作用和较高的选择性，被广泛用于临床抗菌药物的治疗中。

## Cancer biology

- [The main difference between hyperplasia and neoplasia is that hyperplasia is an increase in the number of cells either due to physiological or pathological conditions, whereas neoplasia is unregulated cell proliferation due to genetic changes](https://pediaa.com/what-is-the-difference-between-hyperplasia-and-neoplasia/). Hyperplasia is generally benign, meaning that once the stimulus causing it is removed, the abnormal increase in cell number stops. [On the other hand, neoplasia can be malignant](https://www.healthresearchpolicy.org/hyperplastic/).
- <u>A micronucleus</u> is a small nucleus that forms whenever a chromosome or a fragment of a chromosome is not incorporated into one of the daughter nuclei during cell division. It usually is a sign of genotoxic events and chromosomal instability. Micronuclei are commonly seen in cancerous cells and may indicate genomic instability



### Prostate cancer

The exact mechanisms behind why prostate cancer prefers to metastasize to the bone are not yet fully understood. However, it is known that the bone microenvironment provides a favorable environment for the growth and survival of cancer cells. The bone is rich in growth factors and other signaling molecules that can support the growth of cancer cells. Additionally, the bone is a common site for the spread of cancer cells through the bloodstream, as it is highly vascularized and has a large surface area for cancer cells to attach and grow.

# Physics

- Dissipated work is a concept in thermodynamics that refers to the amount of work that is lost to heat during a process. When work is done on or by a system, some of the energy may be transferred to the system’s surroundings as heat. This heat transfer represents a loss of useful energy, as it is no longer available to do work. The amount of work that is lost in this way is called dissipated work. For example, when you rub your hands together, you are doing work to overcome the friction between your hands. Some of the energy from this work is transferred to your hands as heat, warming them up. This heat transfer represents dissipated work.
- Rupture force 断裂力 is the external force put on a material of interest that causes it to break or rupture. It can be calculated using a formula that takes into account the load force and size dimensions of the material. It can also be measured using an atomic force microscope (AFM) for single covalent bonds
