# Statistical Mechanics and Molecular Simulation

Since there's too many equations to number and refer to, I'll write this in LaTeX.

Just read the following PDF.



```pdf
/course/Physics-biophysics/statistical-mechanics/demo.pdf
```





To use [QYXF LaTeX template](https://gitee.com/qyxf/qyxf-book) in English:

- change all `ctexbook` into `book`; comment the `\ctexset` command
- `\titleformat{\chapter}.....`
- `\renewcommand{\tablename}{Tab.}`, etc.
- if you'd like to include a little Chinese, add `\usepackage{ctex}` **before** the section title settings
  - `\ctexset` in .cls cannot be used...just for ctexbook?
- date: `\ctexset{today=old}`
- change `作品信息、环境名称` in the .cls
- you may also want to modify `\titlecontents` (and other customization)
-
