# Chapter 1 Intro

The fastest way to know about SRAS-Cov-2 at first, is sequencing and comparing with other viruses.

## Concepts

Heredity: Heredity: The familiar? phenomenon whereby **traits** (including clinical traits) are **transmitted from generationto generation**, due to the transmission of genes from parent to child.

Genetics: The scientific study of heredity and of the genes that provide the physical, biological conceptual bases for heredity and inheritance (继承). At molecular level, it also studies the information flow through the central dogma (mechanism of heredity).

Variation: expressed in alternative forms of a trait. widespread in nature.

Genotype: genetic makeup; Phenotype: physical appearance. Study their relationship

> Nature vs Nurture debate

Mendelian Disorder: 

- monogenic or polygenic, simpler mechanism
- Full or high penetrance(外显率)/effect size; one main gene variant is responsible
- Examples: sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis.

Complex disease/trait

- A trait that does not follow Mendelian Inheritance patterns.
- Result from variation within multiple genes 
- and their interaction with behavioral and **environmental** factors.

Genomics: The scientific study of a genome or genomes.

Genome: The **complete set of genetic information** of a gamete (配子), an individual, a population, species, including all of its genes.

> usually the nuclear genome. contains all information to build and maintain the organism

Omics: ....

| meaning         | all genes and non-coding sequences | focus on function of a single gene |
|                 |                                    |                                    |

The recent 20 years

![1-20y](E:\GitHub_repo\notes\course\other\genetics.assets\1-20y.png)

> - 2001: draft verison of human genome
> - 2003: ENCODE, non-coding sequence?
> - 2005: GWAS, phenotype/genotype
> - 2008: 1000 genomes
> - ......faster and faster
> - other omics; genome editing, conprehensive map, single cell
