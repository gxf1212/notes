# Chapter 1 Intro

The fastest way to know about SRAS-Cov-2 at first, is sequencing and comparing with other viruses.

## Concepts

Heredity: Heredity: The familiar? phenomenon whereby **traits** (including clinical traits) are **transmitted from generationto generation**, due to the transmission of genes from parent to child.

Genetics: The scientific study of heredity and of the genes that provide the physical, biological conceptual bases for heredity and inheritance (继承). At molecular level, it also studies the information flow through the central dogma (mechanism of heredity).

Variation: expressed in alternative forms of a trait. widespread in nature.

Genotype: genetic makeup; Phenotype: physical appearance. Study their relationship

> Nature vs Nurture debate

Mendelian Disorder: 

- monogenic or polygenic, simpler mechanism
- Full or high penetrance(外显率)/effect size; one main gene variant is responsible
- Examples: sickle cell anemia and cystic fibrosis.

Complex disease/trait

- A trait that does not follow Mendelian Inheritance patterns.
- Result from variation within multiple genes 
- and their interaction with behavioral and **environmental** factors.

Genomics: The scientific study of a genome or genomes.

Genome: The **complete set of genetic information** of a gamete (配子), an individual, a population, species, including all of its genes.

> usually the nuclear genome. contains all information to build and maintain the organism

Omics: ....

# Chapter 2 Mendel's Principle of Heredity





Genes: Discrete units of inheritance, determine the heredity that affects certain characteristics. 

Each individual has 2 copies of each gene

Allele: alternative forms of a gene

Dominant allele: determines the organism's appearance

Recessive allele: has no noticeable effect on appearanceHomozygous: An organism with two identical alleles fora character

Heterozygous: An organism that has two differentalleles oor a gene

Gametes (配子): eggs or sperm cells

Zygote (合子): fertilized egg, with two copies of genes



The Law of Segregation (分离定律): The two alleles for each traitseparate (segregate) during gamete formation, thenunite at random, one from each parent, at fertilization.



Test cross: breeding the mystery individual of dominant phenotype with a homozygous recessive individual.

- lf any offspring display the recessive phenotype, themystery parent must be heterozygous

Dihybrid cross: Crossing two true-breeding parents differing in two traitsproduces dihybrids in the F1generation, heterozygous forboth traits.

> Reciprocal cross is a kind of crossing strategy, which means to make crosses between a pair of parents (A and B) by using them in turn as female parent and male parent to obtain two reciprocal crosses of A×B and B×A (usually a cross is expressed in the way that the first parent is female and the second parent is male).



Parental type: those progeny that possess the phenotype of at least one of the individuals involved in the mating

Recombinant type



The Law of Independent Assortment: Duringgamete formation, different pairs of allelessegregate independently of each other.

## Applications

c. Probabilities

The product rule: independent events occurring together (*and*), multiply the probabilities.

The sum rule: either of exclusive events occurring (*or*), add the probabilities.
