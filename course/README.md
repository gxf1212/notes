**Notes**

1. if you want to include figures, you should set the path as (an example):
   
    ```shell
    <img src="https://gitee.com/gxf1212/notes/raw/master/course/molecular-immunology/molecular-immunology.assets/5-c1q.png" alt="5-c1q" style="zoom:50%;" />
    ```

    i.e. use the API provided by Gitee. 
    
    - And it does not matter whether you use slash or backslash (but it matters locally in Typora...).
    - If centering is needed, you should use `<center></center>`.
    - You should not use space to avoid issues in html (%20).
    
    > You should write normally in Typora (go back to root), don't change that until figrues are uploaded. 
    >
    > First correct all slashes, then replace `../../` with the website prefix
    
1. Then after deploying, you should press Ctrl+F5, which will cost ten seconds or so. Or you will see the cache where the content is not updated!
   
2. note that katex only supports these environments that you often use (of course something other):
   - aligned
   - gathered
   - cases
   - various matrices, array
