## Notes

1. if you want to include figures, you should set the path as (an example):
   
    ```shell
    ../../course/molecular-immunology/molecular-immunology.assets/figure.png
    ```

    i.e. all the way back into root and then come back.
2. note that katex only supports these environments that you often use (of course something other):
   - aligned
   - gathered
   - cases
   - various matrices, array
