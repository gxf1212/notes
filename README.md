# Notes Site

This site shows some of my notes on Linux fundamentals, software installing, molecular dynamics simulation tutorials \& experiences, and more importantly, notes on core courses.

> You may notice that TOCs in sidebar and navigating bar are generally the same.

I'm just too lazy to make things clear, so these are just what I wrote when I learned. Maybe it's mainly for synchronizing notes 2333...
