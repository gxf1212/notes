# Notes Site

I am a graduate student in biophysics in ZJU. This site shows some of my notes on Linux \& softwares, molecular dynamics simulation tutorials \& experiences, and notes on core courses.

> You may notice that TOCs in sidebar and navigating bar are generally the same.

I'm just too lazy to make things clear, so these are just what I wrote when I learned. Maybe it's mainly for synchronizing notes 2333...

My Bilibili channel: [东山月光下](https://space.bilibili.com/441196634). From time to time, I will share full courses, specialized mini-lecture, animated demonstrations and cutting-edge lectures in macromolecular structure study, molecular dynamics simulation/statistical thermodynamics, oncology and immunology. English-Chinese dual subtitles are added for videos from YouTube. Please subscribe and triple click (一键三连)! Representatives:

## TODO and plans

- [ ] RENAME MD TO RESEARCH
  - [ ] a recent task is: put contents considering common tool usage in UROPS and FYP.md to other md files (programming, tools) and FEbuilder document. Those project documents are going to record the workflow of a specific task (virtual screening, FEP, etc.).
- [ ] **beautify the theme** (sidebar?), I'm lazy...
- [ ] try interesting plugins
- [ ] make badges? beautify hyperref?
- [ ] English/Chinese management
- [ ] build another site to share large amount of textbooks below with GitHub or Gitee (any suggestions?)
- [ ] Bilibili preview (cover) for the above representatives?
- [ ] PDF previewer and meta info
- [ ] 也许有一天，博客的课程列表那里能做成iGem那个建模首页那样，文字和图片的。
- [ ] 添加网站背景音乐
- [ ] 。。。
