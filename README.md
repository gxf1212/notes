# Notes Site

This site shows some of my notes on Linux fundamentals, software installing, molecular dynamics simulation tutorials \& experiences, and more importantly, notes on core courses.

> You may notice that TOCs in sidebar and navigating bar are generally the same.

I'm just too lazy to make things clear, so these are just what I wrote when I learned. Maybe it's mainly for synchronizing notes 2333...

My Bilibili channel: [东山月光下](https://space.bilibili.com/441196634). from time to time, I will share complete courses, specialized mini-lecture, animated demonstrations and cutting-edge lectures in macromolecular structure study, molecular dynamics simulation/statistical thermodynamics, oncology and immunology.


## TOC and plans

- [x] Linux study
- [x] MD study
- [x] systematic notes (course, LaTeX?)
- [x] applications I played, what I did in senior year

other TODOs:

- [ ] beautify the theme (sidebar?), try interesting plugins
- [ ] make badges?
- [ ] correct figure paths and LaTeX formula
- [ ] try to include mindmaps
- [ ] English or Chinese?
- [ ] build another site to share large amount of textbooks below with GitHub or Gitee (any suggestions?)
