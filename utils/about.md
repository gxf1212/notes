My name is Xufan Gao (高旭帆). In Chinese it means sailing to the horizon where the sun rises above the sea.

I've developed a huge interest in math, physics and especially chemistry as soon as I met them. I love writing equations for a physical problem and appreciating chemical structures. Though those may not be the real science, it's a good start. I was admitted into the best high school in our province (even around China). Though under the pressure of competition like mountains on the top, I met admirable friends, patient and considerable teachers, a free environment (vacations, uniform-free months, basketball, teenage love), supportive parents. I felt so happy I was once a part of them. 

My classmates (and I) easily won 2nd prize in provincial-level contests in math, physics and chemistry. Oh, I got the first prize in chem, reading tons of books and exercises. That's why I developed interest in chemical structures. But today's not a day to recall iridescent chemistry memories. In one sentence, any strange covalent comounds formed by usual elemtent surprises us; organic synthesis routes is embedded with infinite possibilities; coordination compounds are artworks that we can draw for days...

Unluckily, I almost failed in Chinese in the College Entrance Exam (CEE,高考). I enjoy Chinese traditional poems (and even wrote some) and get immersed in beautiful proses, though I'm really worse at Chinese exams than others. But I deem that it is real, heartfelt emotions that make your lines shine. I don't mind being short of splendid words, being mocked. I always try to write down the touching moments in life.

Entering the university, I realized that science is based on but totally different from what we learned before. Chemistry is, because I saw all professors trying to create a strange new materials (create new substances, no wrong). That's not playing with skeletal formulas on the paper! I also ruined experiments I've already did back in high school. I did not get anything new in the beginning chem courses; instead, biology filled in since the second year. I started to get away from chemistry.

It's strange that I turned to biology. I hating memorizing, so verbose names for animals and plants ruled out of mind. I'm always wondering how we humans clear pathogens, regulate the hormones and respond to stimulations. I hope to crack the mystery of diseases and beat them into the ground. That might be why many of my classmates chose medicine schools (also the CEE score required is a bit lower to be admitted). But I will certainly focus on the molecular level, studying the chemistry of life. That's not completely biochemistry because it's still hard for computer simulations to deal with reactions. I wanna try to study molecular recognition, which is the most attractive concept in biology. A biologist just says, molecule A is phosphorylated, enabling it to bind to molecule B, and B releases its B1 subunit, which activates the catalytic subunit...(yes, I'm talking about GPCR and PKA). Why does it happen? Biologists usually only cares about "it works" (in molecular level), which is unbearable for a chemist. I hate the word "mutaion". It is a representative of biological thinking: try to change and see what happen. I like (generalized) structural biology better. I care about the fundamental mechanisms: what residues/interactions are there, how allosteric effect occurs, why there's selectivity, what we can design to perturb the system... A proper model explains everything on it level (I mean without QM we can't describe the electronic distribution well). Biomacromolecule structure is an intriguing field for chembioers, and now, physicists and computational scientists. We are using principles of thermodynamics, the techniques of computations, to study biochemical processes. What a interdisciplinary situation! I must figure out how to introduce such a major to my non-science relatives. Maybe system biology is somewhat interesting, but I don't know much about that previously.

I didn't do much research during the four years, because I don't think I'll work well in wet lab. You just work like a horse. Besides, not a single professor works on biomolecular MD (maybe some in the School of Material Science...). I tried to work on bioinformatics × deep learning, but I childishly thought I can step into this field through a hardly-participated project...sadly there's no chemistry there, only genomics and statistics.

So I work with myself. I got addicted to computer techniques. I don't plan to be a programmer, as it's too late. Computers are the most wonderful toys to play with. You can create more than you think. I learned typesetting with LaTeX and markdown, building blogs (what you are reading), searching for online open lectures, processing videos, programming for DNA sequencing and games, trying softwares. And so on. I'm a permanent resident of our library which is named after Qian Xuesen. A laptop (sometimes an iPad also) is everything I need. You are independent of equipments. No, you aren't. To have a comfortable (re-install-able...) environment (to play with Linux extensively), to perform intensive high-performance computations, I bought a machine with GPU. It helps a lot; however, the remote control software is driving me crazy until today. That's why I have so much to write in these notes. This kind of life places unimaginable burden on my bright eyes. I promise I'll take good care of them.

As for achievements, nothing much to show. You may want to have a sight of our [iGem Modeling](https://2020.igem.org/Team:XJTU-China/Model), where we try to explain and draw colorful diagrams. I wish our later teams to win more and greater prizes, if they still get funded.

I love my organization: the academic consultancy center of Qian Xuesen College. It's where I started to learn computer techniques. 
- The old team: https://github.com/qyxf/ with the old info site: https://qyxf.github.io/
- Now they're all here: https://gitee.com/qyxf with a bookhub https://qyxf.site
- [the LaTeX book template](https://gitee.com/qyxf/qyxf-book) is also recommended, the older version of which empowered me 

I appreciate our college to provide me two journeys to foreign top universities with most expenses reimbursed. These are the best days ever. 

This notes site is not a place for sharing photos, etc.

I'm saying goodbye to Youyi Road after precious seven years. I'm finally gonna leave Xi'an \& Xianyang where I born and my soul will rest to start the 5-year molecular biophysics Ph.D journey in Zhejiang University. That is distant, so unknown, that it seems that the university life (or adult life) finally begins. I hope it will be a cute place to hang out (the West Lake). I don't know what the life is like, if there's still opportunity to study abroad. I don't know if it's wrong to insist in MD simulation rather than learning from big data, and give up Peking and Tsinghua University, etc. Perhaps other groups are more mature with what they do (e.g. protein design). Perhaps I may get used to those studies. But I can't live without chemical structures. Recently I'm surrounded with discussions about small molecule drugs. That's a great topic. Protein design is so much fun too. Is there a grand unified theory for molecular recognition and allosteric effect? But whatever computation is only a part of real science (you have to test in reality). What will I do?

We all have one go to make a decision; once it's made, you can never look back. Just go for it.
