I've developed a huge interest in math, physics and especially chemistry as soon as I met them. I love writing equations for a physical problem and appreciating chemical structures. Though those may not be the real science, it's a good start. I was admitted into the best high school in our province (even around China). Though under the pressure of competition like mountains on the top, I met admirable friends, patient and considerable teachers, a free environment (vacations, uniform-free months, basketball, teenage love), supportive parents. I felt so happy I was once a part of them. 

My classmates (and I) easily won 2nd prize in provincial-level contests in math, physics and chemistry. Oh, I got the first prize in chem, reading tons of books and exercises. That's why I developed interest in chemical structures. But today's not a day to recall iridescent chemistry memories. In one sentence, any strange covalent comounds formed by usual elemtent surprises us; organic synthesis routes is embedded with infinite possibilities; coordination compounds are artworks that we can draw for days...

Unluckily, I failed in Chinese in the College Entrance Exam. I enjoy Chinese traditional poems (and even wrote some) and get immersed in beautiful proses, though I'm really worse at Chinese exams than others. But I deem that it is real, heartfelt emotions that make your lines shine. I don't mind being short of splendid words, being mocked. I always try to write down the touching moments.

Entering the university, I realized that science is based on but totally different from what we learned before. Chemistry is, because I saw all professors trying to create a strange new materials (create new substances, no wrong). That's not playing with skeletal formulas on the paper! I also ruined experiments I've already did back in high school. I did not get anything new in the beginning chem courses; instead, biology filled in since the second year. I started to get away from chemistry.

It's strange that I turned to biology. I hating memorizing, so verbose names for animals and plants ruled out of mind. 

I don't plan to be a programmer, as it's too late. Computers are the most wonderful toys to play with. You can create a world of your own.

I didn't do much research during the 4 years. Nothing much to show. You may want to visit our [iGem Modeling](https://2020.igem.org/Team:XJTU-China/Model), where we try to explain and draw colorful diagrams. I wish our later teams to win more and greater prizes, if they still get funded.

I love my organization: the academic consultancy center of Qian Xuesen College. It's where I started to learn computer techniques.

- Now they're all here: https://gitee.com/qyxf with a bookhub https://qyxf.site

I appreciate our college to provide me two journeys to foreign top universities with most expenses reimbursed.

I'm a permanent resident of our library which is also named after Qian Xuesen.

I'm gonna leave Xi'an \& Xianyang where I born start the 5-year Ph.D journey in Zhejiang University. That is so far away, so unknown, that it seems that the university life (or adult life) finally begins.
