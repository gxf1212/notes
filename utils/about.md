# About me

As for achievements, nothing much to show. I appreciate our college to provide me two journeys to foreign top universities (University of Alberta, National Univerisity of Singapore) with most expenses reimbursed. These are the best days ever, doing what you want and melting in incomparable sceneries. But this notes site is not a place for sharing photos, etc. You may want to have a sight of our [iGem Modeling](https://2020.igem.org/Team:XJTU-China/Model), where we try to explain and draw colorful diagrams. I wish our later teams to win more and greater prizes, if they still get funded.

I love my organization: the academic consultancy center of Qian Xuesen College. It's where I started to learn computer techniques. 

- The old team: https://github.com/qyxf/ with the old info site: https://qyxf.github.io/
- Now they're all here: https://gitee.com/qyxf with a bookhub https://qyxf.site
- [the LaTeX book template](https://gitee.com/qyxf/qyxf-book) is also recommended, the older version of which empowered me 

I'm saying goodbye to Youyi Road after precious seven years. I'm finally gonna leave Xi'an \& Xianyang where I born and my soul will rest to start the 5-year molecular biophysics Ph.D journey in Zhejiang University. That is distant, so unknown, that it seems that the university life (or adult life) finally begins. I hope it will be a cute place to hang out (around the West Lake). I don't know what the life is like, if there's still opportunity to study abroad. I don't know if it's wrong to insist in MD simulation rather than learning from big data, and give up Peking and Tsinghua University, etc. Perhaps other groups are more mature with what they do (e.g. protein design). Perhaps I may get used to those studies. But I can't live without chemical structures. Recently I'm surrounded with discussions about small molecule drugs. That's a great topic. Protein design is so much fun too. Is there a grand unified theory to expl molecular recognition and allosteric effect? Can we propose a solution to eradicate tumors? But whatever computation is only a part of real science (you have to test in reality). What will I do?

We all have one go to make a decision; once it's made, you can never look back. Just go for it.
