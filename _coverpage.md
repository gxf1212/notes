# Notes Site

This site shows some of my notes on Linux fundamentals, software installing and molecular dynamics simulation tutorials \& experiences. If I'm going to write notes on courses, I'll build a new, cleaner site for each one.

> You may notice that TOCs in sidebar and navigating bar are actually the same.

I'm just too lazy to make things clear, so these are just what I wrote when I learn. Maybe it's mainly for synchronizing protocols 2333....Later I'll also integrate what I wrote in Windows.

In my project, there's information specific for the project. While in the Linux study, the content is continuously being updated. As I don't have 中文 input method in Singapore, most of the content is in English.

## TOC and plans
